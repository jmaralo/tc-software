// This code writes a greeting based on the name and surname

const my_name = "John"
const my_surname = "Doe"

// we can concatenate strings by using the '+' operator
console.log("Hello, " + my_name + " " + my_surname)

// Or by using this syntax we can embed any variable in a string
console.log(`Hello, ${my_name} ${my_surname}`)
